    * Category methods only work when linked with -ObjC, Three20 gets angry with -ObjC
    * Problem potentially due to having libjson linked to Three20, not directly to Cineti executable?
    * Problem potentially due to libtool bug where category methods ignored without a class in the file (unless -ObjC set)?
    * Use Three20's included SBJSON lib? https://github.com/facebook/three20/tree/master/src/extThree20JSON/ https://github.com/facebook/three20/blob/master/Articles/AboutModules.mdown
